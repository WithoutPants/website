# Steps for forking

We want the codebase to be fork-able at any point you might feel we're not doing a sufficiently good job and are for some reason are not seeing eye to eye.  The beauty of Open Source software is you do not need to wait for us to catch up with you if you wish to hit the ground running.  We encourage you to do exactly that by hopefully making this entire project self contained and functional by default.  

Ideally we won't accept commits that contain broken code, this can be simulated with squashing and rebasing before force pushing your forks.  This way anyone pulling code will always have something reasonably functional to work off of and expect to compliment and not argue with your patches.
